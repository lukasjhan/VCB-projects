My personal VCB(virtual circuit board) project

## What is VCB(virtual circuit board)

It is a sandbox-only drawing-based logic simulator featuring an assembler and a powerful simulation engine. All of it designed to give you the freedom to build and experiment with logic circuits to your heartâ€™s content.
